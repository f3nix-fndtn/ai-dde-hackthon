| How can I prove the authenticity of a video showing war crimes? | Provide information about the date, location, events depicted, author, source, and chain of custody. 1 | p.17 A.6. Videos can be admitted into evidence if relevance and prima facie authenticity is demonstrated by providing information about the date, the location, the events depicted, the author, the source, and/or the chain of custody. Keyword: probative value; relevance; authenticity; chain of custody; admissibility Pursuant to Article 69(4) of the Rome Statute, the Court may rule on the relevance or admissibility of any evidence.  |
| What if I only have excerpts of a video? | You must provide context, explain who extracted the segments, and why the full video is unavailable. The opposing party may provide additional excerpts for context. 2 | p.11 31 Excerpts. If, nevertheless, a party seeks to tender excerpts, the tendering party should also clearly indicate whether the full footage was available and who extracted the segments of the video.32 The opposing party may tender additional excerpts to assist the Court in contextualising the segments sought to be admitted. 33 The ICC Trial Chamber in Ntaganda 28 For example, Prosecutor v Ntaganda (Decision on the conduct of proceedings) ICC-01/04-02/06-619 (2 June 2015\) (TC VI) \[56\]. |
| Can I use photographs to prove a war crime? | Yes, if you provide reliable information on the date, location, and events depicted. If the quality is poor or details are unclear, witness testimonies from those present at the site can corroborate the content. 3 | p. 23 102 B.3. The content of photographs can be corroborated by witnesses present at the moment they were taken. Keywords: relevance, probative value; witnesses; contemporaneity Where photographic evidence is of poor quality or it is unclear who took them and/or how they were developed, consistent testimonies from credible witnesses who were at the site can corroborate the content of the photographs. 103 The ICC Trial Chamber in Ntaganda noted the consistency of evidence from photographs taken from credible witnesses, and the consistent testimony from seven witnesses, with which it was able to satisfy itself that the photographs did indeed depict the aftermath of a massacre. |
| How do I use aerial or satellite images as evidence? | They can corroborate real evidence, witness testimony, and intercepted communications. 4 | p. 25 C. Aerial and Satellite Images Definition Although Courts and Tribunals do not provide a standardised definition of this type of DDE, the term 'satellite images' has been used to describe digitally transmitted images taken by artificial satellites orbiting the Earth 115 and the term 'aerial images' has been used to describe images taken from the sky by aircrafts or drones (also known as Unmanned Aerial Vehicles (UAVs). 116 C.1. Where forensic evidence including aerial and satellite images is voluminous, it may be entered into evidence via expert reports summarising the forensic evidence. Keywords: procedure; experts; forensic evidence; summary report Pursuant to Rule 92 bis (A) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure… |
| Can intercepts be used if they were obtained illegally? | They may be admissible depending on the manner and circumstances in which they were obtained, as well as their reliability and potential effect on the integrity of the proceedings. A court will consider all relevant circumstances and exclude evidence only if the integrity of the proceedings would be seriously damaged. 5 | p.39 206 Illegally Obtained Intercepts. Pursuant to Rule 95 of the ICTR Rules of Procedure and Evidence, 'no evidence shall be admissible if obtained by methods which cast substantial doubt on its reliability or if its admission is antithetical to, and would seriously damage, the integrity of the proceedings'. 207 Nevertheless, illegally obtained intercepts will not necessarily contradict the Rule. |
| How can I ensure intercepted communications are admissible? | Ensure there are accurate translations and transcripts. Not all mistakes will affect admissibility, but relevance cannot be assessed without translation. 6 | p.35 D.4. Relevance of intercepts, which are not in a working language of the Court, may not be assessed when there is no relevant and accurate translation. Not all mistakes in translations or transcripts are material or affect the substance and understanding of the document. Keywords: relevance; probative value; prejudice; translation; transcription The relevance of an intercept cannot be demonstrated if there is no translation available. The ICTY Trial Chamber in Tolimir held that since there was no English translation uploaded to the eCourt system, the Court was unable to assess the relevance of two intercepts, 180 Transcripts and Translations of Detention Center Intercepts by the Defence or Prosecutor instead of a Third Party. |
| What should I do if there are discrepancies between handwritten and electronically typed transcripts of intercepts? | The evidence may still be considered relevant and probative, as such discrepancies do not automatically lead to inadmissibility. 7 | p.38 Transcripts of intercepts may be considered prima facie relevant and probative even when discrepancies exist between their handwritten and electronically typed versions. Keywords: relevance; probative value; transcription Pursuant to Rule 89(C) of the ICTY Rules of Procedure and Evidence, despite possible discrepancies between original handwritten transcripted versions of intercepts and their respective electronically-typed transcripted versions, the Court may still consider these intercepts to be prima facie relevant and probative. |
| Can I use Call Data Records (CDRs) to show the accused's location? | CDRs and Call Sequence Tables (CSTs) can be used with other evidence or relied on independently to support factual assertions. For example, they can demonstrate that target telephones were organized and operated as a closed group, which may support charges of co-perpetration or conspiracy. 8 | p/44 Instead, the CDRs should be rendered intelligible through Call Sequence Tables (CSTs). The STL Prosecution in Ayyash et al produced a CST presenting a chronological sequence of calls relating to a target telephone number over a specified period of time, comprising relevant CDR information including: the other telephone number in contact with the target telephone number, the time and date of the call, the type of call and duration, the IMEI number231 of the handset used by the target number, and the cell identity and cell sector name of the cell sector used by the target number at the start and end of the call. 232 In contrast to the CDRs, the STL Trial Chamber admitted the CSTs into evidence. 233 Ε.2. |
| How do I admit audio recordings into evidence? | Demonstrate their relevance and probative value. They should be submitted in their entirety, along with transcripts and translations. 9 | p.51 50 F. Audio Recordings Definition Audio recordings are recordings ‘made on any disc, tape or other device on which sounds are recorded so as to be capable of being reproduced’.274 For the purposes of these Guidelines, audio recordings are not intercepted. F.1. Instead of excerpts, audio recordings should be submitted in their entirety. Keywords: procedure p.52 51 F.2. Audio recordings of media broadcasts are relevant if they refer to events that took place during the time period relevant to the charges and are contemporaneous with the events. Keywords: relevance; media broadcasts; contemporaneity Audio recordings of media broadcasts should be contemporaneous to the events they purport to demonstrate. |
| What if the digital evidence was collected in violation of privacy rights? | Evidence obtained in violation of internationally recognized human rights is inadmissible if it would damage the integrity of the proceedings. However, the collection of intercepted communications or CDRs is not a violation of privacy if lawful, necessary, and proportionate. 10 | p.39 D.8. The collection of intercepted communication evidence will not constitute a violation of privacy if it is provided for by law, necessary, and proportionate. Keywords: prejudice; privacy Pursuant to Article 69(7) of the Rome Statute, evidence obtained in violation of the ICC's statutory scheme or international human rights is not admissible. The admission of such evidence would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings. The collection of intercepted communication would not be considered a violation of the right to privacy if measures impacting this right are lawful, necessary and proportionate. p/48 261 E.5. The collection and transfer of Call Data Records will not constitute a violation of international human rights standards regarding privacy if the collection and transfer are provided for by law, necessary, and proportionate. Keywords: prejudice; privacy; data collection; data transfer Pursuant to Article 69(7) of the Rome Statute, evidence obtained by means of a violation of internationally recognised human rights shall not be admissible if the admission would be antithetical to and would seriously damage the integrity of the proceedings. |
