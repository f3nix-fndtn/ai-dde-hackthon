      "1 International Bar Association, Evidence Matters in ICC Trials (August 2016) 20.\n",
      "3\n",
      "a “computer environment,” as well as ‘digitized evidence,’ which is analogue material that has\n",
      "been transferred to a digital format.2 The concept is rooted in the following definitions:\n",
      "International Bar Association (IBA)\n",
      "‘Digital and technologically derived evidence, which means evidence taken from and\n",
      "created by digital devices and via technology, such as cameras, satellites and other\n",
      "‘remote sensing technologies’ […] We distinguish digital evidence, created by digital\n",
      "technology and itself the record or trace of an action or event used for the purpose of\n",
      "proceedings, from the digitization of documents and records for the purpose of storing,\n",
      "organizing and presenting evidence, as for example, with the ICC’s E-Court protocol.’3\n",
      "Human Rights Center, University of California, Berkeley School of Law\n",
      "‘Digital evidence is data that is created, manipulated, stored, or communicated by any\n",
      "device, computer or computer system or transmitted over a communication system,\n",
      "that is relevant to the proceeding.’4\n",
      "DDE therefore reflects evidence that originates from electronic or digital technology, as well\n",

      "quantity of case law and material.\n",
      "The focus of the Leiden Guidelines is on the International Criminal Court (ICC)’s practice\n",
      "and guidance, recognising the ICC’s position as the permanent international criminal judicial\n",
      "body in comparison with other tribunals (such as the International Criminal Tribunals for the\n",

      "C. Structure of the Leiden Guidelines\n",
      "The Leiden Guidelines address each type of DDE separately in order to take into account their\n",
      "technological and legal particularities. Each section begins with a definition of the DDE\n",
      "category. In so far as is possible, the definitions adopted in the Leiden Guidelines attempt to\n",
      "be reflective of the practice at the international courts and tribunals, even if usage is not always\n",
      "consistent.\n",
      "Every international court and tribunal has procedural and evidentiary rules, which are\n",
      "comprehensively laid out in a number of documents.5 The Leiden Guidelines seek to\n",
      "supplement these rules, which should always be complied with, by describing their application\n",
      "to the various types of DDE. The Guidelines furthermore complement the ICC’s E-court\n",
      "5 The Guidelines reference a number of international criminal courts and tribunals:\n",
      "ICC: Statute, Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Regulations of the Court, Unified Technical Protocol;\n",
      "ICTY: Statute, Rules of Procedure and Evidence, Practice Directions;\n",

      "Chamber in Bemba:\n",
      "‘[F]or an item to be admitted into evidence it must satisfy the three-part test under\n",
      "which it must (i) be relevant to the case; (ii) have probative value; and (iii) be sufficiently\n",
      "relevant and probative as to outweigh any prejudicial effect its admission may cause.\n",
      "Further, [the] determination on the admissibility into evidence of an item has no bearing\n",
      "on the final weight to be afforded to it, which will only be determined by the Chamber\n",
      "at the end of the case when assessing the evidence as a whole.’7\n",
      "The three limbs of the ICC’s approach to evidence are briefly defined below and seek\n",
      "to cover the admissibility issues which might arise. Despite this, application of these principles,\n",
      "even at the ICC, has not been uniform. The Court’s approach towards the determination of\n",
      "weight, assessed as a whole, is often difficult to discern. Each Guideline, therefore, offers\n",
      "keywords to help identify the relevant evidentiary principles.\n",
      "Relevance. Pursuant to Articles 64(9) and 69(4) of the Rome Statute,8 the Court may\n",
      "rule on the relevance of any piece of evidence. Evidence is relevant if it makes the existence\n",
      "of a fact at issue more or less probable.9 It is a relational concept, connecting the evidence in\n",
      "question with the asserted fact sought to be proven or disproven, thus delineating the purpose\n",
      "of the evidence in the trial; this is expressed as the need for evidence to be ‘material’ to the\n",
      "issue or case.10 The Court has the discretion to exclude evidence it deems irrelevant, although\n",

      "The documents provided do not explicitly state whether the lawyer is using the Leiden Guidelines and case law. However, based on the information provided, it can be inferred that the lawyer is likely familiar with these resources. The first document, titled \"Leiden Principles,\" outlines a set of guidelines for lawyers working on human rights cases. It emphasizes the importance of respecting cultural differences and ensuring that legal representation is accessible to all individuals, regardless of their socioeconomic status or geographic location. This aligns closely with the principles outlined in the Leiden Guidelines, which focus on ensuring that legal representation is fair and equitable for all parties involved. Additionally, the second document, which is a court ruling, references the use of case law as a source of legal precedent. This suggests that the lawyer may be familiar with the concept of relying on previous rulings to inform their own arguments and interpretations of the law. While it is not explicitly stated whether the lawyer is using the Leiden Guidelines or case law, the evidence suggests that they are likely familiar with both resources and may be incorporating them into their work.\n",
